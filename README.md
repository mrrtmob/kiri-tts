# Kiri TTS 🇰🇭🗣️  
**Community-driven Khmer Text-to-Speech Project**

Welcome to **Kiri TTS**, an open community initiative to build a **Khmer text-to-speech (TTS)** model created *by* the community, *for* the community.

Our goal is to make Khmer voices accessible, clear, and natural for all kinds of applications — from accessibility tools to digital assistants and media.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a high-quality **Khmer Text-to-Speech** system.  
- Develop open datasets and tools for Khmer speech research.  
- Bring together developers, linguists, voice actors, and contributors.  
- Promote open collaboration for Khmer language technology.

## 🧩 Project Status

Currently in the **planning and community setup** stage.  
We’re gathering interest, contributors, and resources before official development begins.

If you’re interested in joining, please comment on the pinned discussion or contact us through our community channels.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Set up community space (Facebook, Discord, etc.)  
- [ ] Collect and organize Khmer text and audio data  
- [ ] Build preprocessing and phoneme pipeline  
- [ ] Train first community TTS model (baseline)  
- [ ] Release open models and datasets  

---

## ⚙️ Technical Direction (Early Plan)

We’ll start **Kiri TTS** using the **current TTS technology** developed from the closed-source version as a foundation.  

The plan is to:
- Reuse and adapt the existing model architecture and training pipeline.  
- Gradually open up components and workflows for community collaboration.  
- Improve quality and performance through community feedback, new data, and additional training resources.

As the community grows, we’ll explore new methods and architectures together — continuing to refine and advance Khmer TTS technology.

## 📄 License

License will be decided together as a community — likely an open, permissive license that encourages sharing and transparency while protecting contributors.

## 💡 About

**Kiri TTS** started as an idea after building a private Khmer TTS system.  
Now, we want to create a fully community-driven version — open, transparent, and truly Khmer.

The name **“Kiri” (គិរី)** symbolizes strength and stability, reflecting our vision to build a lasting foundation for Khmer language AI.
